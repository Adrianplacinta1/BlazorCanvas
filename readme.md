# BlazorCanvas

I started this project with the intention of learning/exploring what can be done with Blazor and 2d graphics. I am an old-time videogames lover and I always enjoyed coding small games and prototypes in my spare time.

The repository is divided into numbered subfolders, each one with a single example:

- [Example1](https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/tree/master/BlazorCanvas.Example1) shows how to initialize the 2d canvas
- [Example2](https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/tree/master/BlazorCanvas.Example2) shows how to render a sprite and react to the window resize event

The goal is to create small examples, built one on top of the other, showing how easy it is to render 2d elements using Blazor. Eventually I might end up writing a full game, it highly depends on how much time I'll have.

Every example will be explained in detail by an article on my [personal blog](https://www.davideguida.com).
