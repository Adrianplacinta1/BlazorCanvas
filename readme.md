# BlazorCanvas

I started this project with the intention of learning/exploring what can be done with Blazor and 2d graphics. I am an old-time videogames lover and I always enjoyed coding small games and prototypes in my spare time.

The repository is divided into numbered subfolders, each one with a single example:

- [Example1](https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/tree/master/BlazorCanvas.Example1) shows how to initialize the 2d canvas
- [Example2](https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/tree/master/BlazorCanvas.Example2) shows how to render a sprite and react to the window resize event
- [Example3](https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/tree/master/BlazorCanvas.Example3) shows how to move a sprite on the screen
- [Example4](https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/tree/master/BlazorCanvas.Example4) builds on top of the previous one, refactoring and cleaning up the code
- [Example5](https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/tree/master/BlazorCanvas.Example5) shows how to handle mouse inputs
- [Example6](https://github.com/mizrael/BlazorCanvas/tree/master/BlazorCanvas.Example6) shows how to animate a sprite. Spritesheet was downloaded from [here](https://luizmelo.itch.io/medieval-warrior-pack-2) and combined using [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/)

The goal is to create small examples, built one on top of the other, showing how easy it is to render 2d elements using Blazor. Eventually I might end up writing a full game, it highly depends on how much time I'll have.

Every example will be explained in detail by an article on my [personal blog](https://www.davideguida.com).
